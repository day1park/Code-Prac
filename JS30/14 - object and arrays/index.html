      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);
      // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"]

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux";
      // team = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"];
      // players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"];

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();
      // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"];

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players); //another copy
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "heeee hawww";
      console.log(team4);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      // captain.random = 99;
      // person = {
      //   name: "Wes Bos",
      //   age: 80
      //   random: 99
      // };
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { random: 99, age: 12 });
      console.log(captain2);
      // { name: "Wes Bos", age: 80, random: 99 };
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

        name: "wes",

        social: {
          twitter: "@wes",

      };

      console.log(wes);
      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
      // turns object into a string then back into an object with parse
