# Why Methods?
# A method is a reusable section of code written to perform a specific task in a program. You might be wondering why you need to separate your code into methods, rather than just writing everything out in one big chunk. It turns out there are a few good reasons to divide your programs into methods:

# If something goes wrong in your code, it's much easier to find and fix bugs if you've organized your program well. Assigning specific tasks to separate methods helps with this organization.

# By assigning specific tasks to separate methods (an idea computer scientists call separation of concerns), you make your program less redundant and your code more reusableâ€”not only can you repeatedly use the same method in a single program without rewriting it each time, but you can even use that method in another program.

# When we learn more about objects, you'll find out there are a lot of interesting things we can do with methods in Ruby.
